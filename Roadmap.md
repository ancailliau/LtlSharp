# LtlSharp Roadmap

## Probabilistic Systems

Done:

* Markov Chains
  * Reachability Probabilities
  * Transient Reachability Probabilities
  * Qualitative Properties

To do:

* Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic
  * PCTL Model Checking
  * The qualitative fragment of PCTL
* Linear-time properties 
* Model-Checking PCTL*
* Markov Decision Processes
  * Reachability Probabilities
  * PCTL Model Checking
  * Limiting Properties
  * Linear-Time Properties and PCTL*

Future work
